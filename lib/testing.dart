/// The [MockClient] class is a drop-in replacement for `http.Client` that

///     import 'dart:convert';
///     import 'package:http/testing.dart';
///
///     var client = MockClient((request) async {
///       if (request.url.path != "/data.json") {
///         return Response("", 404);
///       }
///       return Response(
///           json.encode({
///             'numbers': [1, 4, 15, 19, 214]
///           }),
///           200,
