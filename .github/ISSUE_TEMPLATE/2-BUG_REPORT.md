name: I found a bug.
about: You found that something which is expected to work, doesn't. The same
  capability works when using `dart:io` or `dart:html` directly.

---

<!--
  Please describe the bug and how to reproduce it.

  Note that if the bug can also be reproduced when going through the interfaces
  provided by `dart:html or `dart:io` directly the bug should be filed against
  the Dart SDK: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues

  A failure to make an http request is more often a problem with the environment
  than with the client.
