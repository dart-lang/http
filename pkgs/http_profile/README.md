[![package publisher](https://img.shields.io/pub/publisher/http_profile.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/http_profile/publisher)

A package that allows HTTP clients outside of the Dart SDK to integrate with
the DevTools Network View.

**NOTE:** This package is meant for developers *implementing* HTTP clients, not
developers *using* HTTP clients.

## Using

`HttpClientRequestProfile.profile` returns an `HttpClientRequestProfile` object
if HTTP profiling is enabled. Populating the fields of that object with
information about an HTTP request and about the response to that request will
make that information show up in the
[DevTools Network View](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/network).

```dart
import 'package:http_profile/http_profile.dart';

Future<String> get(Uri uri) {
  final profile = HttpClientRequestProfile.profile(
    requestStartTime: DateTime.now(),
    requestMethod: 'GET',
    requestUri: uri.toString(),
  );
  profile?.connectionInfo = {
      'localPort': 1285,
      'remotePort': 443,
      'connectionPoolId': '21x23',
    };

  profile.requestData.proxyDetails = HttpProfileProxyData(
    host: 'https://www.example.com',
    username: 'abc123',
    isDirect: true,
    port: 4321,
  );

  // Make the HTTP request and populate the response data.

  profile.responseData.headersListValues = {
    'connection': ['keep-alive'],
    'cache-control': ['max-age=43200'],
    'content-type': ['application/json', 'charset=utf-8'],
  };

  return responseString;
}
```

Refer to the source of
[`package:cupertino_http`](https://github.com/dart-lang/http/blob/master/pkgs/cupertino_http/lib/src/cupertino_client.dart)
to see a comprehensive example of how `package:http_profile` can be integrated
into an HTTP client.

## Status: experimental

**NOTE**: This package is currently experimental and published under the
[labs.dart.dev](https://dart.dev/dart-team-packages) pub publisher in order to
solicit feedback.

For packages in the labs.dart.dev publisher we generally plan to either graduate
the package into a supported publisher (dart.dev, tools.dart.dev) after a period
of feedback and iteration, or discontinue the package. These packages have a
much higher expected rate of API and breaking changes.

Your feedback is valuable and will help us evolve this package. For general
feedback, suggestions, and comments, please file an issue in the
[bug tracker](https://github.com/dart-lang/http/issues).
