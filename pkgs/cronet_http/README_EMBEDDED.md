An Android Flutter plugin that provides access to the
[Cronet](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/cronet/reference/org/chromium/net/package-summary)
HTTP client.

This package is identical to [`package:cronet_http`](https://pub.dev/packages/cronet_http)
except that it embeds
[Cronet](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/cronet/reference/org/chromium/net/package-summary)
rather than using the version included with
[Google Play Services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview).
This increases the uncompressed size of the application by approximately 8MB.

See more details about cronet_http at: https://pub.dev/packages/cronet_http.
